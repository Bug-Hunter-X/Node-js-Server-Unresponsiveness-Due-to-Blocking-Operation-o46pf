# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: server unresponsiveness caused by long-running synchronous operations within the request handler.  The `server.js` file contains a flawed implementation that blocks the event loop, leading to poor performance and inability to handle concurrent requests.

The `serverSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using asynchronous operations to address the problem.  This example highlights the importance of asynchronous programming in Node.js to maintain responsiveness and scalability.
